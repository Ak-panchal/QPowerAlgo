## Bernstein Vazirani Algorithm
The Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm, which solves the Bernstein–Vazirani problem is a quantum algorithm invented by Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani in 1992. It's a restricted version of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm where instead of distinguishing between two different classes of functions, it tries to learn a string encoded in a function. The Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm was designed to prove an oracle separation between complexity classes BQP and BPP.

Some great resources to understand the algorithm and implement with qiskit:
